# High/Low
Would you like to play a game? Play cards and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. The
Player draws a card, and you must guess if the next card has a higher or lower value than that
initial card. Guess correctly and 100 points are added to your score! Guess incorrectly, and 75
points are taken away. The game ends when you choose for it to end, or if your score reaches 0.

## Getting Started
---
You will need Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 hilo 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- hilo                (source code for game)
