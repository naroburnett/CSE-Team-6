# Jumper
A man is skydiving with a faulty parachute, and it is your job to ensure he makes it to the ground safely! The rules are simple. A random 5-letter word is generated from a large list, and you must guess the letters that make up that word. For each you get correct, you become one step closer to victory! But for each you get wrong, our fellow Jumper loses another piece of his parachute! Guess incorrectly too many times, and our helpless friend is left falling to his death. Can you save him from such a gruesome and terrible fate?

## Getting Started
---
You will need Python 3.8.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command:

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the jumper folder and click the "run" button.
